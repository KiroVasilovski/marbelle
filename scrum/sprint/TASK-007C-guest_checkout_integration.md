# Task TASK-007C: Guest Checkout Integration

## State: Backlog
## Story Points: 4
## Priority: High
## Stack: Backend + Frontend

## Dependencies
- **TASK-007A**: Core Authentication (requires registration/login system)
- **TASK-008**: Shopping Cart System (requires cart functionality)

**As a** guest customer  
**I want** to complete purchases without creating an account  
**So that** I can buy quickly without signup friction

**As a** guest customer  
**I want** to easily create an account after checkout  
**So that** I can track my order and save my information for future purchases

**As a** returning customer  
**I want** my guest cart to merge with my account cart when I login  
**So that** I don't lose items I've already selected

## Business Rules

### **Guest Cart Management**
- Guest carts stored in localStorage with 30-day expiration
- Guest session ID generated for cart tracking
- Cart items validated against current product availability
- Guest carts automatically cleaned up after conversion to user

### **Cart Merge Logic**
- When guest logs in, merge guest cart with user cart
- Duplicate products: combine quantities (respect stock limits)
- Guest cart takes precedence for newer items
- Merge operation logged for troubleshooting

### **Guest Order Conversion**
- Guest orders can be claimed by creating account with same email
- Guest order information pre-fills account creation form
- Account verification required but order remains accessible
- Guest order tracking remains available even after account creation

### **Account Creation Incentives**

- Show account creation during multiple checkout steps
- Never force account creation - always optional
- Professional messaging for business customers

## UI/UX Design Specifications

- Loading states during cart synchronization
- Success feedback for cart merge operations

## Security Considerations
- Guest session security and cleanup
- Secure guest order lookup (email + order number required)
- Protection against guest order enumeration attacks
- Rate limiting for guest order lookup attempts
- Secure localStorage cart data (no sensitive information)

## Performance Requirements
- Guest cart operations complete within 500ms
- Cart merge completes within 2 seconds
- Guest order lookup responds within 1 second
- localStorage cart size limited to prevent performance issues
- Efficient cart synchronization on login

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### **Cart Management Scenarios**
- Guest cart expires during checkout
- Product goes out of stock in guest cart
- User already has items in cart when guest cart merges
- localStorage not available or disabled

### **Account Conversion Scenarios**
- Guest email already exists as user account
- Guest order email doesn't match account creation email
- Network interruption during account conversion
- Email verification fails for converted account
