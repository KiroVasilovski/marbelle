# Task TASK-007C-FE: Guest Checkout Integration - Frontend

## State: Backlog
## Story Points: 2
## Priority: High
## Stack: Frontend

## Parent Task
- **TASK-007C**: Guest Checkout Integration (parent task - will be completed when both BE and FE subtasks are done)

## Dependencies
- **TASK-007A-FE**: Core Authentication Frontend (requires login/registration components)
- **TASK-007C-BE**: Guest Checkout Backend (requires guest cart/order APIs)
- **TASK-008-FE**: Shopping Cart Frontend (requires cart functionality)

**As a** guest customer  
**I want** to complete purchases without creating an account  
**So that** I can buy quickly without signup friction

**As a** guest customer  
**I want** to easily create an account after checkout  
**So that** I can track my order and save information for future purchases

**As a** returning customer  
**I want** my guest cart to merge with my account cart when I login  
**So that** I don't lose items I've already selected
