## Email Change Endpoints

### Request Email Change

```http
POST /auth/request-email-change/
```

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
    "current_password": "CurrentPassword123",
    "new_email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Email change verification sent. Please check your new email to confirm the change."
}
```

**Security Features:**
- Requires current password re-authentication
- New email must be different from current email
- New email must not already exist in system
- Only one pending email change per user (new request overwrites old)
- Rate limited: 1000 requests per minute per user

### Confirm Email Change

```http
POST /auth/confirm-email-change/
```

**Request:**
```json
{
    "token": "email_change_token_here"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Email address changed successfully. You can now use your new email to login.",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "email": "newemail@example.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "company_name": "Acme Corp",
        "phone": "+1234567890",
        "is_business_customer": true
    }
}
```

**Security Features:**
- No authentication required (uses secure token)
- Token expires in 24 hours
- Single-use token (becomes invalid after use)
- Old email receives security notification
- Username updated to match new email
- Rate limited: 1000 requests per minute per IP

### Email Change Workflow

The industry-standard email change process follows these steps:

1. **User Authentication**: User re-enters current password
2. **New Email Submission**: User provides new email address
3. **Verification Email**: Token sent to NEW email address
4. **Email Confirmation**: User clicks link/enters token â†’ email actually changes
5. **Security Notification**: Old email gets notified of the change

**Business Rules:**
- Current email remains active until new one is verified
- Failed verification keeps original email unchanged
- User can have only one pending email change at a time
- New requests override previous pending changes

## Quick Examples

### Complete Authentication Flow

```bash
# 1. Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe","password":"Pass123","password_confirm":"Pass123"}'

# 2. Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"Pass123"}'

# 3. Access protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/user/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Address Management Flow

```bash
# List addresses
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/addresses/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Create address
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/addresses/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"Home","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe","address_line_1":"123 Main St","city":"NYC","state":"NY","postal_code":"10001","country":"USA"}'

# Set as primary
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/addresses/1/set_primary/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Email Change Flow

```bash
# 1. Request email change (requires current password)

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"current_password":"CurrentPassword123","new_email":"newemail@example.com"}'

# 2. User receives email at newemail@example.com with verification link
